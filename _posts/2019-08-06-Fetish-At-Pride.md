What does everyon think about Fetish at Pride? Our view is that the Fetish community belongs at Pride and deserves to be represented along with the rest of the LGBT community. With the UK Fetish Alliance, our goal is to promote, educate and clear some of the myths of the Fetish community and to ensure that the LGBT Fetish Men and Women along with their allies can march proudly at Gay Pride events around the country.
