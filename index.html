	<h1>UK Fetish Alliance</h1>
	<p>The UK Fetish Alliance exists to promote the LGBT Fetish community and lifestyle in the UK</p>
	<p>Through social activisim, community outreach and engagement, we aim to promote and educate on healthy, consensual and fun Fetish lifestyles. Along with our allies, both in the hetero-sexual and LGBT communities, we will show and foster support for issues affecting the LGBT Fetish community. Here are some example areas we want to promote:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fetish community participation in PRIDE marches around the UK</li>
		<li>Transgender community support</li>
		<li>Counter traditional demonisation of the Fetish community</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Our group will be increasingly active over the next few months as we formalise our mission statement and objectives</p>
